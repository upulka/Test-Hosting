:::note What are Blockchain Accounts?

A mandatory requirement is for the wallet users to create their own Blockchain accounts. From here you can create multiple Blockchain accounts and a private and public key is generated for them for each account from which they could do their transactions.

:::

Since Wallet is directly connected with Blockchain, it is mandatory to create a Blockchain account for each Wallet user.


After the initial login, you must create a Blockchain account by entering an account name and a password for transactions.
