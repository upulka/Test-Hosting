Recall Management comprises four main functionalities.

## Recalls

![MarineGEO circle logo](../../static/img/insights10.png "MarineGEO logo")

Already recalled products will be displayed in the table grid along with the details such as Batch ID, recalled reason, stage and date and time of recall. 

Previously recalled batches can be searched by the recall name or filter the batches which have been recalled during a particular period of time through the date range filter option. 

Recalls can be notified through the *yellow speaker icon* at the last column of each recalled product. 



## Recall Notices

Notices about each recalled product can be created here using the icon at the ‘Notify’ column.

Once clicked on the icon, you will be shown a pop up window to add the recall notice.

Then the Recall Title and Batch Identifier will be auto retrieved from the system and filled, only the required notice can be typed and saved.
A meaningful notice should be created conveying the receivers about the recall and its gravity.

If you continue recalling the batch, fill in the fields in white by adding an appropriate name for the recall and also by adding the reason for the recall (ex: damaged, perished etc).
Fields in grey are disables and cannot be edited as those data are retrieved from the system automatically.

The recalled batch will be shown in red in order to let you know that there is something wrong with the particular batch




## Recall Teams

![MarineGEO circle logo](../../static/img/insights19.png "MarineGEO logo")

Recall Teams can be assigned to lead the recalls. Recall teams will document all recall actions, including consumer, distributor, supplier and public communications in order to reduce the risk of recall.
Any number of team members can be added to a team and those teams can be edited or deleted as per the requirement.




### Creating New Teams

New recall teams can be added by clicking on the “Create New Team” button.

![MarineGEO circle logo](../../static/img/insights20.png "MarineGEO logo") 

A meaningful and an identifiable team name should be given and the related recall should be selected to the team here. Each recall team should consist of at least one member and once all those fields are correctly filled, a team will be added and details will be saved successfully. 




### Viewing the team members

Assigned team members of each team can be viewed through the yellow team button in the ‘Team Members’ column of the table.
