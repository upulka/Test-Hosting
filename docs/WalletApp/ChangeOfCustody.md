## Send Items (Transfer)

</p>


Once you select the **‘Transfer’** tab, you can see a list of items that you have access to use. The asset code (item name) and the amount (quantity) is displayed here as well. 

To send these assets to another account, you need to tap on one item and that will redirect to a form in which you have to enter the transfer details.

### Add image

Each real world item/ product is represented by an asset in the Tracified Wallet. You can enter the identifier of the product or you can scan it’s QR / barcode. You can scan one or many identifiers under one specific asset to perform a ‘Transfer’ transaction.

</p>

You have to enter the asset amount that you want to transfer under **‘Quantity’** and the **‘Receiver Account Name’**.

</p>

After entering the name, if it's valid it will show their account name on the pop up screen with an option to select. 

You can set a time-bound validity as well. 


This will ensure that you want the receiver to respond to this within a given period of time. If they don’t accept or reject your request within the set time period it will automatically get expired.

Once you fill in all fields click on the **‘Transfer’** button. Then you will see a pop up window asking you to enter the Blockchain Password.

<p align="center">
<img height = "350px" src="https://i.ibb.co/jw6yTfy/wall13.png" /> 
</p>


Here you will see all the details of the already sent items, the status (accepted, pending or rejected) and their validity period as well. 


## Received Items



The received items can be viewed through the ‘Received’ option at the bottom bar of the screen.


You will get notified in the app when you receive any item to your account.


<p align="center">

</p>


In received items, you can view each transfer and their request status, asset code, asset amount, sender details and the validity period as well.


You can either accept or reject this request before it expires. Until that period, it will be in the  **‘Pending’** state. 


<p align="center">

</p>


Once you click accept or reject it will ask you to enter your Blockchain password to confirm the action and once it's validated, the rest of the process will be executed.
