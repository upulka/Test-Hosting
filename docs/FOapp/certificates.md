Certifications can be issued  through the Tracified Officer App, by selecting a template which is created through the ‘Tracified Configs Portal’. The validity date period of each certificate should be selected and then the quantity of the product that the certificate will be issued to, and the farm name from where the product came from should also be chosen. 
You can also upload photos as proof of quality, and then have to select the template which was defined through the configs portal. Once the certificate is issued, its information will be displayed at the **‘Safety Card’** of the consumer app.
