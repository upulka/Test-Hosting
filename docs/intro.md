# Introduction to Tracified


## What is Tracified



<VideoIframe></VideoIframe>

Tracified powered by Blockchain technology facilitates a tamper proof platform that streamlines the data flow within a supply chain, introducing a novel crypto-economic model based on a reward/penalty concept, ensuring fair distribution of gains across the chain. The originality of the solution is further enhanced by its ability to get customized to suit the needs of a business. 

A blockchain based platform that adds the crucial element ‘trust’ to traceability information. This applies to any buyer – seller scenario that occurs in a supply chain (not only the end-consumer). Trust is achieved by 3 pillars in tracified.1) blockchain based direct proofs 2) web of trust 3) security deposits by improving trust, tracified enables smarter purchasing decisions from the buyers side while making it possible for sellers who sell genuinely high quality products to prove their value.
