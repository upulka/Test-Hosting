# Getting Started

There are two types of users which can subscribe to Tracified; 

- ** Ecommerce Users** -  Users who already own a shopify or woocommerce shop.
- **Non Ecommerce Users** - Users who are entirely new and who don’t own a shopify or   woocommerce shop.


Ecommerce Users can install the Tracified plugin from the Shopify Appstore and can subscribe to the Tracified Services through the billing page.
