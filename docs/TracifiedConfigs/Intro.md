Tracified configs will be where the configurations made by the users to augment the system to their supply chain. This includes storage of [workflow](../intro#workflow) and [artifact](../intro#artifacts--master-data) configurations and Field Officer user interfaces. Tracified will allow the users to create their [workflows](../intro#workflow)  ** through two options**.

```
1. Using sample workflow and artifact templates.

2. Creating workflows manually.

```

Lets add the option auto generate or manual creation.

When creating the [workflows](../intro#workflow) manually, [artifacts](../intro#artifacts--master-data) should be defined first.
