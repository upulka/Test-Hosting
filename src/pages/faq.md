- **How is Tracified different from other blockchain based traceability products?**

There are few products and solutions that claim to deliver supply chain traceability with blockchain. Most of these solutions use the blockchain only for its immutable ledger. On top of that they provide guarantees that the traceability data have not been tampered after they have reached the blockchain. However, this is not sufficient to build credibility into it as the data can be manipulated in numerous ways before they even reach the blockchain.

- ** Different roles involved in a traceability ecosystem and trust relationships among them is an important dimension of supply chain traceability. What are the key roles that Tracified recognizes? **

1. Traceability Advocate: The organization in the supply chain that leads the traceability initiative 
2. Quality Custodian: Any person / organization that handles a product / item at any stage in the supply chain 
3. Oracle: A person / organization that inputs data pertaining to a certain characteristic of the product / item e.g. A lab that conducts a test and uploads a report 
4. Registrar: A trusted person / organization (e.g. NGO, government) who has both authority and competency to perform some admin level functions such as visiting a farm and specifying its maximum monthly output of organic produce or specifying acceptable ranges of ratios for mixing ingredients (for example mixing milk and salt to produce cheese) 
5. Regulatory body: e.g. customs 
6. Certification Authority: An accredited organization for issuing a certificate 
7. Buyers 


- **What are the types of data handled within Tracified?**

1. Master Data These are the type of data that define entities in the business that do not change often; for example, farmers, farms, warehouses, communities, delivery services, etc. in an agri supply chain 
2. Tracking Data This refers to the data collected from items and batches while they move through the supply chain. Therefore, tracking data has a very dynamic nature. Examples are temperature readings taken in warehouses, soil quality reports, information on weeding, photos of items. 
3. Social Data Social data defines trust structures formed among people and organizations involved in a supply chain. These data are vital for information filtration and summarization. For instance, a buyer may see only the traceability information endorsed by his trusted network. 
4. Economic Data These are the economic assurances provided by the seller on his traceability claims.


- **How can tracking data be fed into Tracified system?** 

Data is injected to the system in three ways. 
1. Manual entry via mobile apps by people working in the supply chain.
2. Automatic feed from sensors.
3. Imports from other digital systems such as ERPs.
