import DocsRating from '@site/src/core/DocsRating';

[Workflow](../intro#workflow) creation can be done for all [stages](../intro#stage) of the supply chain through Tracified Configs Portal.

You can add new [stages](../intro#stage) to the process, as per your requirement, through the **'+ Stage ' **button.

Select the newly created [stages](../intro#stage) and you can add relevant fields to a particular [stages](../intro#stage) through the ** '+ Field'** button.

You can select the nature of the data as [artifacts](../intro#artifacts--master-data), list or single.

If you want to have your users add data using [artifacts](../intro#artifacts--master-data), you can choose the artifact function.

If you enable the ** ‘Required’** toggl button, filling the data fields will be mandatory.

Select the Merger Function (recommended ‘Carry Forward’)

If the list is selected, you can enter list items as you need, or even remove them while creating and also can select the required merge function.

If you choose the ‘single’ option, it will let the field officer users enter the data type you configure here.

If you toggle the prefix and postfix, you can enter some text that should be available before or after the numerical value.
(ex: it can be a measurement unit or a value that is common to all)

** Text** - this option will enable the field officers to enter text

Here also you can enable the prefix and postfix option.

Once all these are correctly added, click on the **‘Publish’** button to get them added to the [Workflow](../intro#workflow). (This may sometimes take a while as the whole [Workflow](../intro#workflow) process should be created within the system automatically)

One or more fields can be merged together to make a group. Click on the ‘Next: Group’ button to create a new group for the added fields.

![MarineGEO circle logo](../../static/img/config17.png "MarineGEO logo")

Drag and drop the required fields to be grouped together to the dark grey box, and click on ‘Add to Group’ button. Then you will be asked to enter a suitable name for the new group. Enter a meaningful name and just click enter to make them grouped successfully.

You can now publish the group by clicking on the **‘Publish’ ** button. Then you will see an alert saying the process was successfully completed.
